Prior to the explosion, the sidewalk outside the home had been spray-painted with the letters \"JDL.\"  Though no one claimed credit for the bombing and the Jewish Defense League (JDL) actually denied responsibility, authorities believe it was the action of the JDL, as Ashley's house had been previously broken into and vandalized with slogans saying \"Never Again\" and \"No More Holocaust.\"\n",

Two women, both employees of the agency, and an off-duty police officer, were slightly injured by shards of flying glass from the explosion.  Additionally, the explosion destroyed the side wall of the agency, causing extensive damage, and also damaged a jewelry store on the first floor and the apartment of an elderly couple on the third floor.  Less than an hour after the blast, a man called the Associated Press and a local TV station, claiming bombing and identifying himself as a member of the Croatian Freedom Fighters.  He also stated that a message was left in a locker at the terminal at 421 Grand Central Station.  The message was written in Croatian and listed a series of demands that the group asked be aired on television and radio between 6pm and 7pm that evening, otherwise 2 more bombs, which were placed in congested areas, would be detonated at 8:30pm that evening. The group's message, which denounced  the Yugoslav Secret Police, and asked that the U.S. stop economic aid to Yugoslavia  and that political and economic ties to Yugoslavia by the U.S. and West Germany be broken, was aired, and no other bombs were detonated.\n",

The bomb was thrown from a vehicle and exploded when it hit the ground in front of the consulate.

      "summary: 10/02/1980: Three white teenagers firebombed the home of a black family in a predominantly white neighborhood in Manchester, Connecticut, United States.   The molotov cocktail was thrown through a bedroom window of the home of Bruce Meggett and Lucinda Harris, who were not home at the time of the incident.  Four children, ranging in ages from 6 years old to 15 years old, and their uncle were in the home when the lighted gasoline firebomb bounced off of the arm of the 6-year old girl and exploded, setting the home on fire.  No one was injured in the incident, but the fire caused $7,800 in damages to the home.  Though authorities believe that this incident had no involvement from the Ku Klux Klan, it occurred three weeks after the  Klan held its first public rally in the state in more than 70 years.  However, the bombing was intended to intimidate the family and other black families in the area, and infringe upon the family's housing rights. Charles N. Metheny and Eugene R. Gilliland were arrested and indicted for the arson, and a third suspect was being sought by police.\n",

Two white teenagers from the neighborhood were arrested as suspects and authorities were searching for additional suspects.  The Gant family was one of few black families in the white Polish neighborhood, and authorities confirmed that the gasoline bombing was racially motivated.

Then, another member of The Order, made a warning phone call to the cashier at the theater, but before any precautions could be taken, the bomb exploded, leaving minimal damage, destroying about 10 seats in the theater, and no casualties.  The motive for the bombing was twofold: first, to spread the group's message that pornography was intolerable and second, to act as a diversion for the group's planned armored car robbery the next day (907).\n",

      "summary: 12/22/2001: On American Airlines Flight 63 en route to Miami, Florida, from Paris, France, Richard Reid attempted to detonate explosives in his shoes by igniting them with a match.  After several attempts Reid was unsuccessful, possibly due to moisture on the fuse, and was restrained by passengers when a flight attendant smelled sulphur from the lit match.  Doctors on board sedated Reid while the flight was escorted to Boston's Logan Airport by two U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter jets.  All 185 passengers and 12 crew members were safely removed; several had minor injuries including a flight attendant who was bitten by the perpetrator when she confronted him.  Reid's shoes contained detonator wire and the plastic explosives triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and pentrite (PETN) that could have destroyed the plane if detonated.  Reid, a petty criminal who converted to Islam while in jail and was trained by al-Qaida, ultimately pled guilty to all charges related to the incident and was sentenced to life in prison on January 30, 2003.\n",

In December 2011, al Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released an audio recording claiming responsibility for the kidnapping and stating that Weinstein would be released if a number of demands were met, including the release of prisoners and an end to bombing in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Gaza. In May and September 2012, al Qaida released videos of Weinstein asking authorities to negotiate his release. In August 2014 al Qaida released another statement encouraging Weinstein's family to pressure the US government to negotiate for his release. In January 2015 an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan sentenced convicted kidnapper Hafiz Imran to death. Weinstein was accidentally killed in a United States air strike on January 14, 2015.\n",

The explosion killed two, including the alleged bomb carrier, and injured 24. Amongst the injured were the governor of Sulu, Abdusakur Tan, and a British national, Charles McKercher. The amount of property damage is unknown. The attack came just before the United States ambassador to the Philippines, Harry Thomas, was to arrive; he canceled the visit. Sakur Tan claimed that he was the likely target of the bomb. \"I have received intelligence reports that I would be bombed,\" he told local TV on Friday. Police are investigating the theory that the suspected bomber may not have known he was carrying a bomb which may have been detonated remotely. No group claimed responsibility, but the Abu Sayyaf was suspected.\n",

      "summary: 04/15/2013: An explosive device consisting of a pressure cooker, nails, BBs, and a detonator fashioned from the remote control of a toy car detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Boylston Street in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States. This was the first of two similar bombs that detonated approximately 12 seconds and 100 yards apart. The detonation of first device, which was located near Marathon Sports, killed spectator Krystle Campbell. Approximately 264 others were wounded in the two attacks. The alleged assailants of the blasts were later identified as Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, brothers who immigrated to the United States from Russia in 2002 and 2003. On April 19, 2013, as part of an attempt to flee the Boston area, the assailants were involved in a shootout with police that resulted in the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested later that evening after he was discovered hiding in a boat that was parked in a Watertown, Massachusetts resident's backyard. Tsarnaev had written a claim of responsibility on the side of the boat. On July 10, 2013, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to 30 federal counts related to the attack, including one for the use of a weapon of mass destruction. Tsarnaev was ultimately found guilty on all counts, and sentenced to the death penalty on June 24, 2015.\n",

      "summary: 04/15/2013: An explosive device consisting of a pressure cooker, nails, BBs, and a detonator fashioned from the remote control of a toy car went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Boylston Street in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, United States. This was the second of two similar bombs that detonated approximately 12 seconds and 100 yards apart. The detonation of second device, which was located near Forum Restaurant, killed spectators Martin Richard and Lingzi Lu. Approximately 264 others were wounded in the two attacks. The alleged assailants of the blasts were later identified as Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, brothers who immigrated to the United States from Russia in 2002 and 2003. On April 19, 2013, as part of an attempt to flee the Boston area, the assailants were involved in a shootout with police that resulted in the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested later that evening after he was discovered hiding in a boat that was parked in a Watertown, Massachusetts resident's backyard. Tsarnaev had written a claim of responsibility on the side of the boat. On July 10, 2013, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to 30 federal counts related to the attack, including one for the use of a weapon of mass destruction. Tsarnaev was ultimately found guilty on all counts, and sentenced to the death penalty on June 24, 2015.\n",

In the set incidents that occurred on May 3, 2002, seven nearly identical bombs were found by mail carriers and residents in or near mailboxes between 10:49am and 2:30pm in eastern Iowa and western Illinois, including this one in Illinois. Six of the seven bombs detonated, injuring four mail carriers and two residents. Each of the bombs had a note in a plastic bag, which stated, \"I'm obtaining your attention in the only way I can .... more attention-getters are on the way.\" On May 7, 2002, the FBI and Nevada state authorities arrested Luke Helder, a 21-year-old college student, who confessed to being responsible for all of the bombs.\n",

In the set incidents that occurred on May 3, 2002, seven nearly identical bombs were found by mail carriers and residents in or near mailboxes between 10:49am and 2:30pm in eastern Iowa and western Illinois, including this one in Illinois. Six of the seven bombs detonated, injuring four mail carriers and two residents. Each of the bombs had a note in a plastic bag, which stated, \"I'm obtaining your attention in the only way I can .... more attention-getters are on the way.\" On May 7, 2002, the FBI and Nevada state authorities arrested Luke Helder, a 21-year-old college student, who confessed to being responsible for all of the bombs.\n",

The bomb was placed under bushes near an executive doorway and a parking space used by the founder and chairman of the corporation, Leon Hirsch, and the device(according to Trutt) was intended to scare Hirsch into stopping the company's use of live dogs in research and in testing its surgical stapling products on the animals.  Trutt was arrested at the time she planted the bomb, but was intending to wait until 8am to detonate the bomb when Hirsch arrived to work.  The bomb later detonated when police attempted to dismantle it at another location after the device was seized.  Trutt was eventually charged, pleaded no-contest, and was sentenced to one year in prison followed by three years of probation for the attempted murder.\n",

The device was composed of two sections of thin wire strung tight across the road, tied to a cattle fence on one side and a mesquite tree on the other, four feet above the ground. It was believed to target U.S. Border Patrol agents riding all terrain vehicles who patrol the area. The nearest Mexican town is the village of Las Chepas, a collection of small houses and abandoned buildings routinely used by drug smugglers as a staging ground.

All six bombs exploded, causing $1,000,000 in property damage.  There were no casualties in the incident, and none of the 800 mink in the building were harmed. The same day, a caller phoned the KSL radio station, claiming responsibility for the incident in the name of ALF, and a second call was made to Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade, also claiming the incident in the name of animal rights activists, but there was no specific reference to a person or group.  The perpetrators, Alexander David Slack, Clinton Colby Ellerman, Douglas Joshua Ellerman, Sean Albert Gautschy,  Adam Troy Peace, and Andrew Bishop, were arrested and indicted for their involvement in the incident and an alleged earlier attempt to bomb the co-op, which was aborted when they saw police presence.  After a trial, Sean Albert Gautschy,  Adam Troy Peace, and Andrew Bishop were acquitted, while Clinton Ellerman was sentenced to 5 years in prison, Douglas Ellerman to 7 years (which was later reduced by 13 months); Slack committed suicide months prior to the trial.\n",

The bomb, which was homemade by Pierce and consisted of three sticks of dynamite, an electric blasting cap, a battery, and a timer, caused minor damage to the synagogue's kitchen and heating equipment, in the amount of $4,000.  No casualties resulted from the blast, which Pierce later described as an \"act of war\" to serve \"the greater good,\" even though he initially intended the bombing to be a test of his homemade device.  However, the bombing occurred at the start of a week-long national convention to commemorate victims of the Holocaust.\n",

The explosion occurred in the second-floor probation office and caused severe damage including a 10-foot hole in the floor, windows shattered and damage to the outside brick wall, but no casualties resulted from this incident.  The bombing is linked to the an explosive attack on the Dorchester Army National Guard in Boston as well as the destruction of an airliner at Logan International Airport on the same day (197607020008, 197607020009) and also the bombing of a post office in Seabrook, New Hampshire (197607020007).  In October 1976, Everett C. Carlson was convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison for transporting explosives in the three attacks as was Richard J. Picariello in February 1977, and in March 1977, Edward P. Gullion was also convicted and awaiting sentencing; Joseph Aceto was also responsible for the attacks and pleaded guilty in September 1976 and subsequently became a government witness in the later trials.\n",

No casualties resulted from the incident, but the explosion caused extensive property damage including shattered windows.  The bombing was preceded by two warning calls by a member of the UFF, one call to the Rye Hilton hotel and another to Stouffer's Inn.  A communiqué from the UFF was left at the scene, claiming that the IBM corporation had committed crimes against the people of South Africa by selling computer parts to the South African government.\n",

      "summary: 06/22/1985: Two bombs exploded in the Moslem prayer room at the Daar Us Salaam mosque in Houston, Texas, United States, about an hour after worshippers left the mosque.  There were no casualties in the incident, but the explosions caused about $50,000 in damages.  Daniel Allen Russell, Randy James Jones, and Stephen C. Ahern, all of Houston, were all charged and sentenced after their admissions to constructing and planting the bombs in the mosque.  It appears that the perpetrators acted independently of any group, and their reasons for the bombing, while conflicting, are suspected to be in retaliation and anger over American hostages being held in Lebanon during the Shiite Moslem hijacking of passengers aboard TWA Flight 847.  The bombing came in the midst of threatening phone calls to several area mosques and Islamic society headquarters after the hostage situation in Beirut.\n",

The second and third explosions caused minor injury to a police officer on the scene who was treated for smoke inhalation.  Paster, who was not part of the Rajneeshee sect, was charged and convicted of arson and sentenced to 20 years in prison.  Authorities suspected that he was part of a Muslim sect, and the incident has been attributed to Jamaat-al-Fuqra by sources, but this is unclear.  Police were also searching for two other perpetrators who were believed to also be responsible for the incident.\n",

      "summary: 04/19/2013: Police thwarted a potential bomb attack when they engaged in a firefight with the alleged assailants of the Boston Marathon bombings, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, in Watertown, Massachusetts, United States. Shortly after hijacking a civilian vehicle, the suspects were confronted by police, leading to a firefight that resulted in the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and 16 police officers were injured in the exchange. One of the injured officers, Dennis Simmonds, succumbed to his injuries on April 10, 2014. During the encounter, the suspects hurled explosives at the officers. It was later revealed that the Tsarnaev brothers were plotting to use the explosives to carry out an attack in an unconfirmed location. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested later that evening after he was discovered hiding in a boat that was parked in a Watertown, Massachusetts, resident's backyard. Tsarnaev had written a claim of responsibility on the side of the boat. On July 10, 2013, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to 30 federal counts related to the Boston attacks, including one for the use of a weapon of mass destruction.\n",
